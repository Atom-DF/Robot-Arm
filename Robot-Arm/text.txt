played around with the values inside of the move_to_location to make it move bit by bit
no huge movement and only 1 way movement
for it to move the opposite way we would need to use the first motor to rotate it around.
for the cube to be held but not squeezed you need to use 0x01,0xff

we are now trying to drop the cube at prescise points (on targets)

we placed the cube and fiddled with the program in order to reset the robot arm then take the cube reset it again
then drop it off at a certain point and reset again

this is a first step to complete the tower of hanoi problem


for the project the biggest problem is the being able to get the positions right on top of each other
this is a long trial and error process which is hard to

we can make our robot use its predetermine functions to do other things,
such as writing a curvy line, dance.

Biggest issue is the positioning of the robot to the cubes, isn't consistent...
